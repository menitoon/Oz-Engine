Oz-Engine is a text based engine made by @menitoon using python.
It can be used to make games in terminal and with additional modules in discord or any matrix led based screen


#### STARTUP

 ``` pip install Oz-Engine ```
 
 ```python 
 import OzEngine as oz 
 ```


## How to use it

```diff 
+ ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE :  before reading this remind yourself that is still work in progress and unfinished this section  might be changed in the future.Some explanations might be unclear or wrong if so then please report them.
```

### Creating the canvas

Start by instancing a canvas like so: 
```python 
canvas = oz.Canvas("#") 
# The  argument is given what the canvas will be filled with.
```
and then instancing a camera so that we can render the scene.
```python
camera = oz.Camera(canvas , [10 , 10] , [0 , 0] , "camera")
#First argument is the canvas that it belongs to.
#Second argument is the size of the camera.
#Thid argument is the position of the camera.
#And the last one is the name.
```


Now try rendering it:
```python
print(camera.render())
```
You should see a square filled with "#"

## Adding Sprites

It's cool and all but a little boring to have just an empty canvas.
Let's add a sprite:
```python
sprite = oz.Sprite(canvas , "S" , [3 , 3] , "first_sprite" ) 
# "canvas" is the canvas that is associated with the sprite in question
# "S" is character that the sprite will be represented with.
# and "first_sprite" is the name of the sprite
```
feel free to add multiples sprites :) !

## moving functions

If you wanted to move them then simply do that:
```python

# add 1 to x-axis:
sprite.change_x(1) 

# add -1 y-axis:
sprite.change_y(-1)

#set x-axis
sprite.set_x(1)

#set y-axis
sprite.set_y(3)

#set position (x and y)
sprite.set_position([3 , 5])

#add to x and y axis
sprite.change_postion(1 , -1)
#first argument is for "x" and the second for "y"

```

## Useful sprite methods

There are a few important function for sprites that needs to be known.
For example if you want to delete an object
```python
albert_the_sprite.destroy()
```

or to rename it
```python
albert_the_sprite.rename("albert")
```

but also to handle collisions
```python
albert_the_sprite.get_colliding_objects()
```
"get_colliding_objects" is a method that returns all sprites names that colliding with the sprite that execute
the method (albert_the_sprite here)

we can check collision like so:
```python

canvas = oz.Canvas("#")

albert_the_sprite = oz.Sprite(canvas , "a" , [0 , 0] , "albert")
robert_the_sprite = oz.Sprite(canvas , "r" , [0 , 0] , "robert")
billy_the_sprite = oz.Sprite(canvas, "b" , [2 , 0] , "billy")

if "robert" in albert_the_sprite.get_colliding_objects():
  
  print("collides with:" , albert_the_sprite.get_colliding_objects())
  print("robert collided with albert.")

else:

  print("robert didn't collide with albert.")
```

Now if we wanted to execute a method to robert with could use the "get_sprite()"
``` python
canvas.get_sprite("robert").set_position([2 , 0])
```
Please note that you will need to execute this method throught the canvas that is associated with the sprite.

## Groups

"group" is an optional argument of the object "Sprite" that can be used to call a method to each sprite that belong to this group or check collisions between groups.

### Collision with groups

First things first you need to actually define the group that the sprite belongs to:
```python
snake_the_sprite = oz.Sprite(canvas , "s" , [0 , 0] , "albert" , "animal")
cat_the_sprite = oz.Sprite(canvas , "c" , [0 , 0] , "robert" , "animal")

apple_the_sprite = oz.Sprite(canvas , "a" , [0 , 0] , "robert" , "fruit")
```

now we can simply check collision:
```python
print(apple_the_sprite.get_colliding_groups())
#output : ["fruit" , "animal"]


if "animal" in apple_the_sprite.get_colliding_groups():
    print("The fruit was eaten by an animal ")

else:
    print("The fruit is still here :D !")
```

the method "get_colliding_groups()" returns a list that contains every groups that collides with the sprite
that executes the method.

## calling groups

Let's imagine that we are making a game where if a button is pressed all the doors should open
well it would simple just to use the method "call_group()".

but first we need to create our own sprite type : "Door"
we will do so by creating a New class called you guessed it : "Door"

```python

#inherits from class "Sprite"
class Door(Sprite):
  #reusing code from Sprite here:
  #if you want to know what this is for then go to the "How it works" section.
  
  __slots__ = "canvas_owner", "char", "position", "name", "group", "distance", 
  "on_function_ready"

  def __init__(self,
               canvas_owner: object,
               char: str,
               position: list,
               name: str,
               group=None,  
               ):

    
    self.char = char
    self.position = position
    self.name = name
    self.canvas_owner = canvas_owner
    self.group = group

    if name in canvas_owner.sprite_names:
      # change name if already taken
      self.name = name + f"@{str(id(self))}"

    # register infos in "canvas_owner" :
    canvas_owner.sprite_tree.append(self)
    canvas_owner.sprite_names.append(self.name)
    canvas_owner.sprite_names_dict[self.name] = self
    canvas_owner.sprite_position_dict[self] = position

    if not (group in canvas_owner.sprite_group_dict):
      #if group is new then add to "group_tree" and create new key 
      #location for "sprite_group_dict".
      canvas_owner.sprite_group_dict[group] = []
      canvas_owner.group_tree.append(group)

                 
    canvas_owner.sprite_group_dict[group].append(self)


  #our function to open the door
  def open_door(self):
    print(f'door : "{self.name}" was opened !' )

```
and then we can instance the door and call the method
```python
canvas = oz.Canvas("#")

door_one = Door(canvas , "1" , [-4 , 2] , "door_one" , "door")
door_two = Door(canvas , "2" , [2 , -3] , "door_two" , "door")
door_three = Door(canvas , "3" , [3 , 7] , "door_three" , "door")

canvas.call_group("door" , "open_door" )

#output : 
#door : "door_one" was opened !
#door : "door_two" was opened !
#door : door_three was opened !

```

but now let's say we want to give and argument well it's super easy :) 
```python
#add method to the door class
def multiply_x_axis(self , times):
    self.set_x(self.position[0] * times) #position[0] is the x-axis
```

then just call the method:
```python
canvas = oz.Canvas("#")

door_one = Door(canvas , "1" , [-4 , 2] , "door_one" , "door")
door_two = Door(canvas , "2" , [2 , -3] , "door_two" , "door")
door_three = Door(canvas , "3" , [3 , 7] , "door_three" , "door")

print(canvas.sprite_position_dict.values()) #prints all positions
#output before call : dict_values([[-4, 2], [2, -3], [3, 7]])

canvas.call_group("door" , "multiply_x_axis", 2 )
print(canvas.sprite_position_dict.values()) #prints all positions multiplied by 2
#output after call : dict_values([[-4, 2], [2, -3], [3, 7]])
```

giving multiple arguments is possible.


# How it works




To start simple imagine we have a board that is filled with "0"

![](grid_zero.png)

this board can be represented with a 2D-list:
```python
[  
   [0, 0 , 0 , 0, 0],
   [0, 0 , 0 , 0, 0],
   [0, 0 , 0 , 0, 0],
   [0, 0 , 0 , 0, 0],
                       ]
```

and that what the method "clear_canvas" from the "Camera" class makes for you:

``` python
def clear_canvas(self):
    """
    returns a clean canvas, setted
    in to it's empty state
    """

    SIZE_X = self.size[0]
    SIZE_Y = self.size[1]

    line = [self.canvas_owner.VOID for _ in range(SIZE_X)] #creates a list containing the 
                                                           #argument "VOID" 
                                                           #it would give : '[ 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0]'  if SIZE_X = 5 and VOID = 0)

    clear_canvas = [line.copy() for _ in range(SIZE_Y)]    #appends multiple  copies(so we can edit it) of line 
    return clear_canvas                                    #the amount of copies appended depends on the value "SIZE_Y"
    #and we return "clear_canvas".
```

and we should get what we had at first using this function.

## Editing the canvas

Let's bring some life to this empty canvas by using the method "edit_element"

```python

  def edit_element(self, canvas, x, y, char):
    """
    allows to edit an element of a canvas
    """
    # "canvas" is the canvas we want to edit (you'l see later that we always the same one)
    # "y" is the line we want to edit
    # "x" is the element in the line want to edit.
    # and "char" is the character that we replace by the old one.

    (canvas[y])[x] = char 

```

# Classes 

There are 3 Classes In Oz-Engine :

‚¨§ **Canvas**

‚¨§ **Sprite**

‚¨§ **Camera**

## Canvas

Canvas object can be used to store sprite informations
It has one parameter "VOID" which what empty cells look like.

Here is an example :
```python

canvas_fruit = oz.Canvas("o") # "VOID" here is "o"

apple = oz.Sprite(canvas_fruit , "üçé" , [0 , 0] , "apple")
banana = oz.Sprite(canvas_fruit , "üçå" , [1 , 0] , "banana")



canvas_vehicles = oz.Canvas("#")

car = oz.Sprite(canvas_fruit , "üöó" , [0 , 0] , "car")
plane = oz.Sprite(canvas_fruit , "‚úà" , [1 , 0] , "plane")
```

Here "canvas_fruit" does only contain information about "apple" and "banana"
And "canvas_vehicles" contain information about "copybook" and "notebook"


# Methods

## \_\_init\_\_

Nothing particular here just setting up
the given parameters and instantiating variable that are needed.

```python
 def __init__(self, VOID):
    ''' Characters that fills the canvas when nothing is rendered on a tile. '''
    self.VOID = VOID
    '''List that contains every distance of each sprite '''
    self.distance_tree = []
    '''List that contains every reference of each sprite '''
    self.sprite_tree = []
    '''List that contains every groups that exists'''
    self.group_tree = []
    '''List that contains every name of each sprite '''
    self.sprite_names = []
    '''Dictionary that has a sprite reference as a key and the corresponding name as a value'''
    self.sprite_names_dict = {}
    '''Dictionary that has a sprite reference as a key and the corresponding position as a value'''
    self.sprite_position_dict = {}
    '''Dictionary that has a sprite reference as a key and the corresponding group as a value'''
    self.sprite_group_dict = {}
```


## get_sprite

The method "get_sprite" allows to get the reference of sprite by it's name.
It works with a dictionnary that stores names as keys a reference as values.

```python
  def get_sprite(self, name):
    """
    returns reference to sprite that owns the given name
    """

    return self.sprite_names_dict[name]
```

## call_group

Allows you to call a "method" to a group
```python
  def call_group(self, group_to_call: str, method_to_call, *args):
    """
    Call a method  to every sprites that belongs to the group that is
    given 

    like so:

    canvas.call_group("group_name_here" , method_is_going_to_be_called_on_them() )
    
    """

    #gets every sprite that is in the group given
    
    sprite_to_call = self.sprite_group_dict.get(group_to_call)
    if sprite_to_call == None:
      #if group given doesn't exist then sumbit error
      raise Exception(
        f'''The group "{group_to_call}" doesn't exist please specify a valid group to call. '''
      )

    for todo_sprite in sprite_to_call:

      #get function of sprite
      func = getattr(todo_sprite, method_to_call)
      #executes it with the argument given
      func(*args)
```

"sprite_group_dict" is dictionnary that holds every sprite reference that is in the given group.

# Sprite

Sprite objects are used to fill the canvas
they have 5 parameters :

‚¨§ **canvas_owner**

‚¨§ **char**

‚¨§ **position**

‚¨§ **name**

‚¨§ **group**



# Methods

## \_\_init\_\_

Here we just set up the variable that were asked in the parameters



```python

 def __init__(
    self,
    canvas_owner: object,
    char: str,
    position: list,
    name: str,
    group=None,
  ):
    '''Character that represents the sprite when rendered.'''
    self.char = char
    '''List that has two element "x" and "y" it tells where to render the sprite.'''
    self.position = position
    '''Name of the sprite that can be used to get reference from it using the "get_sprite" method throught a "Canvas" object.'''
    self.name = name
    '''Canvas that the sprite is associated to.'''
    self.canvas_owner = canvas_owner
    '''group is a string that be used to call a method on each sprite that has the same method with 
    the method "call_group" through the canvas and it can also be used to check collision by seing which sprite of which
    group is colliding with our sprite with the method "get_colliding_groups" that can be executed by a "Sprite" object. '''
    self.group = group

```

and here we register info to the __canvas_owner__.


```python
    
    if name in canvas_owner.sprite_names:
      # change name if already taken
      self.name = name + f"@{str(id(self))}"

    # register infos in "canvas_owner" :
    canvas_owner.sprite_tree.append(self) # register reference
    canvas_owner.sprite_names.append(self.name) # register name
    canvas_owner.sprite_names_dict[self.name] = self # register name as key and reference as value 
    canvas_owner.sprite_position_dict[self] = position # register reference as key and position as value
    
    if not (group in canvas_owner.sprite_group_dict):
      #if group is new then add to "group_tree" and create new key
      #location for "sprite_group_dict".
      canvas_owner.sprite_group_dict[group] = []
      canvas_owner.group_tree.append(group)

    canvas_owner.sprite_group_dict[group].append(self) #add group reference to the group dict
    #it can looks something like that : { "group" : [sprite_reference1 , sprite_reference2 , ect] }

```

## destroy

__destroy__ is used to delete sprite
it just deletes things that we registered earlier in the __\_\_init\_\___

```python
  def destroy(self):

    del self.canvas_owner.sprite_names_dict[self.name]
    del self.canvas_owner.sprite_position_dict[self]

    #remove self from key that contain every sprite in group
    INDEX = self.canvas_owner.sprite_group_dict[self.group].index(self)
    del (self.canvas_owner.sprite_group_dict[self.group])[INDEX]

    self.canvas_owner.sprite_names.remove(self.name)
    self.canvas_owner.sprite_tree.remove(self)

    if len(self.canvas_owner.sprite_group_dict[self.group]) == 0:
      #delete group if no one is in it.
      del self.canvas_owner.sprite_group_dict[self.group]
      self.canvas_owner.group_tree.remove(self.group)

    del self
```

## rename

__rename__ as it name suggest allows to rename sprites
it changes every time the __old__ name was used by the __new__ one given.
```python
 def rename(self, new_name: str):
    """
    allows to change the name of a sprite, to "rename" it.
    """

    del self.canvas_owner.sprite_names_dict[self.name]

    if new_name in self.canvas_owner.sprite_names:
      # change new_name with object id() if name already taken
      new_name = new_name + f"@{str(id(self))}"

    # change name

    INDEX = self.canvas_owner.sprite_names.index(self.name)
    self.canvas_owner.sprite_names[INDEX] = new_name
    self.name = new_name
    self.canvas_owner.sprite_names_dict[new_name] = self
```

## get_colliding_objects

__get_colliding_object__ works by getting the reference of each sprite that is located at the
same __position__ of the sprite that calls the method.

```python
  def get_colliding_objects(self):
    """
    Returns a list of colliding objects(by name)
    """

    object_colliding = [] 

    sprite_check_list = list(
      self.canvas_owner.sprite_position_dict.copy().keys())
    position_check_list = list(
      self.canvas_owner.sprite_position_dict.copy().values())

    sprite_check_list.remove(self)           #remove self reference
    position_check_list.remove(self.position) #remove self position

    for todo_sprite in sprite_check_list:

      POSITION_CHECK = self.canvas_owner.sprite_position_dict[
        todo_sprite]  # gets the position from key

      if self.position in position_check_list: #checks until the no sprites has the same position

        object_colliding.append(
          todo_sprite.name) if POSITION_CHECK == self.position else None
      else:
        break

    return object_colliding
```

It gives back names of the sprite who are colliding with us.

## get_colliding_groups

It works the same as __get_colliding_objects__ except here it gives the group instead of giving back names.
We check if all groups are in __groups_colliding__.

```python
 def get_colliding_groups(self):
    """
    Returns a list of colliding objects(by groups)
    """

    groups_colliding = []

    sprite_check_list = list(
      self.canvas_owner.sprite_position_dict.copy().keys())
    position_check_list = list(
      self.canvas_owner.sprite_position_dict.copy().values())

    sprite_check_list.remove(self)
    position_check_list.remove(self.position)

    for todo_sprite in sprite_check_list:

      POSITION_CHECK = self.canvas_owner.sprite_position_dict[
        todo_sprite]  # gets the position from key

      if self.position in position_check_list and not (set(
          self.canvas_owner.group_tree) == set(groups_colliding)):

        groups_colliding.append(
          todo_sprite.group) if POSITION_CHECK == self.position else None
      else:
        break

    return groups_colliding

```

## update_distance

__update_distance__ is used to well update distance of your sprite
it's used in every __moving__ / __position__ functions
```python
  def update_distance(self):
    """

        update the dictionary : "sprite_position_dict" of "canvas_owner"
        like so :

        sprite_reference :  sprite_position

        """

    # update it
    self.canvas_owner.sprite_position_dict[self] = self.position
```

## position-based methods

I'm not cover how every position-based method works because they are very similar to each other
but here how one of then works:

```python
  def change_position(self, x_val: int = 0, y_val: int = 0):

    self.position[0] += x_val
    self.position[1] += y_val
    self.update_distance()
```

# Camera

__Camera__ object is used to render __Canvas__ object
it has 4 parameters:

‚¨§ **canvas_owner**

‚¨§ **size**

‚¨§ **position**

‚¨§ **name**


## \_\_init\_\_

Nothing particular here just setting up variables

```python
def __init__(self, canvas_owner: object, size: list, position: list,
               name: str):
    '''canvas that is associated with. '''
    self.canvas_owner = canvas_owner
    '''size of the camera '''
    self.size = size
    ''' position of the camera '''
    self.position = position
    ''' name of the camera'''
    self.name = name
    ''' define the order of rending sprties '''
    self.sprite_render_priority = []
    ''' dictionnary that contain keys "sprite" for value "distance" '''
    self.sprite_distance_dict = {}

    if size == [0, 0]:

      warn(
        f''' size of camera : "{name}" isn't defined so it will most likely not work.\n please define a valid size.'''
      )
```
## update_sprite_distance

This method is used to update all distances of each sprites
```python

  def update_sprite_distance_dict(self):
    """
        update the distance of every sprite
        """

    self.sprite_distance_dict = {} #creates empty dict

    for todo_sprite in self.canvas_owner.sprite_tree: #we interate through every sprite reference
      sprite_position = [                             #and update the distance for each of them
        todo_sprite.position[0] - self.position[0],
        todo_sprite.position[1] - self.position[1]
      ]
      self.sprite_distance_dict[todo_sprite] = self.get_square_distance_to(
        sprite_position)
```


## edit_element

Is used to replace a char by a new one.

```python
  def edit_element(self, canvas, x, y, char):
    """
    allows to edit an element of a canvas
    """

    #canvas[y] gets the line
    # and then with [x] gets the element
    
    (canvas[y])[x] = char
```

## get_square_distance_to

Gives back the sum of the distance of the four corner of the render canvas
```python
  def get_square_distance_to(self, position: list):
    """
    returns the sum of the distance between the 4 corners of the square
    """

    SIZE_X = self.size[0] - 1  
    SIZE_Y = self.size[1] - 1

    corner_top_left = [0, 0]
    corner_top_right = [SIZE_X, 0]
    corner_bottom_right = [SIZE_X, SIZE_Y]
    corner_bottom_left = [0, SIZE_Y]

    return (math.dist(corner_top_left, position) +
            math.dist(corner_top_right, position) +
            math.dist(corner_bottom_right, position) +
            math.dist(corner_bottom_left, position))
```

## is_renderable

Says whetever a sprite can rendered or not.
```python
  def is_renderable(self, distance):
    """
        returns whether a sprite a renderable from the distance given.
        """

    MAX_DISTANCE = (self.get_square_distance_to([0, 0])) #represents the maximum distance to be rendered

    return not (distance + self.get_square_distance_to(self.position)) > (
      MAX_DISTANCE + self.get_square_distance_to(self.position))
```

## render 

__render__ is the main method of __Camera__ it returns back a string that represents the canvas if the parameter __is_string__ is True else returns a the canvas as a 2D-list
```python
  def render(self, is_string=True):
    """
    Returns the rendered canvas as a string if "is_string" is true else as a          2D-list
    """

    self.update_sprite_distance_dict()
    canvas = self.clear_canvas()

    MAX_DISTANCE = (self.get_square_distance_to([0, 0]))

    distances = list(self.sprite_distance_dict.copy().values())
